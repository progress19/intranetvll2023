4. Configuring Firefox to Print to Receipt Printer
VOKAL

2010

    Open File > Page Setup

    Make all the headers and footers blank

    Set the margins to 0 (zero)

    In the address bar of Firefox, type about:config

    Search for print.always_print_silent and double click it

    Change it from false to true

        This lets you skip the Print pop up box that comes up, as well as skipping the step where you have to click OK, automatically printing the right sized slip.

    If print.always_print_silent does not come up

        Right click on a blank area of the preference window

        Select new > Boolean

        Enter "print.always_print_silent" as the name (without quotes)

        Click OK

        Select true for the value

    You may also want to check what is listed for print.print_printer

        You may have to choose Generic/Text Only (or whatever your receipt printer might be named)
